# Gamified Marketing Application

This application deals with gamified consumer data collection. A user registers with a username, a
password and an email. A registered user logs in and accesses a HOME PAGE where a “Questionnaire
of the day” is published.
The HOME PAGE displays the name and the image of the “product of the day” and the product
reviews by other users. The HOME PAGE comprises a link to access a QUESTIONNAIRE PAGE with a
questionnaire divided in two sections: a section with a variable number of marketing questions
about the product of the day (e.g., Q1: “Do you know the product?” Q2: Have you purchased the
product before?” and Q3 “Would you recommend the product to a friend?”) and a section with fixed
inputs for collecting statistical data about the user: age, sex, expertise level (low, medium high). The
user fills in the marketing section, then accesses (with a next button) the statistical section where
she can complete the questionnaire and submit it (with a submit button), cancel it (with a cancel
button), or go back to the previous section and change the answers (with a previous button). All
inputs of the marketing section are mandatory. All inputs of the statistical section are optional.
